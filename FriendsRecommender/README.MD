### Friend recommender
This is a MapReduce program in Hadoop that implements a simple "People You Might Know"
social network friendship recommendation algorithm. The key idea is that if two people have
a lot of mutual friends, then the system should recommend that they connect with each other.

### Input   
The input file contains the adjacency list and has multiple lines in the following format:
<User><TAB><Friends>
Here, <User> is a unique integer ID corresponding to a unique user and <Friends> is a
comma separated list of unique IDs corresponding to the friends of the user with the unique
ID <User>. Note that the friendships are mutual (i.e., edges are undirected): if A is friend
with B then B is also friend with A. The data provided is consistent with that rule as there
is an explicit entry for each side of each edge.

### Algorithm   
Let us use a simple algorithm such that, for each user U, the algorithm recommends N = 10 users who are not already friends with U, but have the most number of
mutual friends in common with U.

### Output   
The output contains one line per user in the following format:
<User><TAB><Recommendations>
where <User> is a unique ID corresponding to a user and <Recommendations> is a comma
separated list of unique IDs corresponding to the algorithmâ€™s recommendation of people that
<User> might know, ordered in decreasing number of mutual friends. Even if a user has
less than 10 second-degree friends, output all of them in decreasing order of the number of
mutual friends. If a user has no friends, we provide an empty list of recommendations.
If there are recommended users with the same number of mutual friends, then output those
user IDs in numerically ascending order.
